// Assertions: FluentAssertions

[Fact]
public async Task LoginWithValidCredentials_ReturnsValidToken()
{
    // Arrange
    var userService = new Mock<IUserService>();
    var tokenService = new TokenService();
    var controller = new AuthController(userService.Object, tokenService);

    // Act
    var result = await controller.Login(new LoginRequest { /* ... */ });

    // Assert
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
    result.Token.Should().NotBeEmpty();
}
```

### Integration Testing

```csharp
// Test complete API endpoint
// Use TestContainers for database
// Test with real database context

[Fact]
public async Task GetProducts_WithFilters_ReturnsFilteredResults()
{
    // Setup: Create test database
    // Add test data
    // Call API endpoint
    // Assert results match filters
}
```

### Performance Testing

```csharp
// Load test scenarios
// Measure response times
// Monitor resource usage
// Identify bottlenecks

public class PerformanceTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task GetProducts_ShouldCompleteIn500ms()
    {
        // Execute 1000 concurrent requests
        // Measure average response time
        // Assert < 500ms
    }
}
```
