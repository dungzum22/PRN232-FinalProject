## Key Resources

**Your Main Documents:**

- `DEVELOPER_TASK_ASSIGNMENTS.md` - Your specific tasks (Phase 1-3)
- `SYSTEM_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete technical design
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - System overview and architecture

**Your Files to Work On:**

- `Gateway/ocelot.json` - Route configuration
- `Gateway/Program.cs` - Gateway setup
- All API `Program.cs` files - Review and approve
- All service `Program.cs` files - Middleware configuration

**Your Tasks (Weeks 1-8+):**

1. **Week 1-2:** API Gateway setup, Auth strategy, Exception handling
2. **Week 3-4:** Data consistency, Performance & caching, Architecture docs
3. **Week 5+:** Code reviews, Technical debt, Team guidance (ongoing)

## Context About Your Project

**System Components:**

- API Gateway (Ocelot) - Central routing point
- 6 Microservices:
  - AuthAPI (Authentication, JWT)
  - UserAPI (User management)
  - ProductAndCategoryAPI (Product catalog)
  - CartAPI (Shopping cart)
  - OrderAPI (Order processing)
  - FeedbackAPI (Reviews/ratings)
  - NotificationAPI (Real-time updates)

**Technology Stack:**

- .NET 8.0, C#, ASP.NET Core
- SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
- Ocelot (API Gateway), JWT Auth
- SignalR (Real-time)
- VNPay (Payment)

**Your Team:**

- You (Dev Lead) - Architecture & oversight
- Dev 2 - Backend (Auth & User)
- Dev 3 - Backend (Product, Cart, Order)
- Dev 4 - Frontend (UserUI, AdminUI)

## How to Use This Agent

Ask me for help with:

- ‚úÖ "Review this architecture decision"
- ‚úÖ "How should we handle this in the gateway?"
- ‚úÖ "What's the best pattern for this integration?"
- ‚úÖ "Review my code for quality issues"
- ‚úÖ "Help me document this design decision"
- ‚úÖ "What security considerations should we address?"
- ‚úÖ "How do we optimize this performance issue?"
- ‚úÖ "Create a code standard for [topic]"

## Phase 1 Tasks Details (Weeks 1-2)

**Task 1.1: API Gateway Configuration (5-6 hours)**

- Set up Ocelot routes for all 6 microservices
