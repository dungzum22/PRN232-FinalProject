Local Dev → GitHub Commit → GitHub Actions Tests → Deploy to Staging
```

### Production Workflow

```
Commit to main → Tests Pass → Vercel Deploy → Render Deploy → Live
```

### Rollback Procedure

```
1. Monitor errors in production
2. Identify problematic commit
3. Revert commit and push to main
4. CI/CD pipeline auto-deploys previous version
5. Verify everything working
```
